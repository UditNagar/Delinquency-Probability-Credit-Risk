# Delinquency Probability of a Customer
Based on Kaggle Competition: Give Me Some Credit

This notebook is created 9 years after this competition ended. The main aim of this project is to predict the probabily whether a customer will default in the future given his record present in the dataset. We will be using predict_proba to determine the delinquency probabilities of the customer.

The Highlights of the notebook are:
